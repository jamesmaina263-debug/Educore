-- Auto-reconciled by scripts/reconcile_migration_drift.py: this version was applied directly to production without a matching git commit at the time. Content below is byte-for-byte what's recorded in supabase_migrations.schema_migrations for version 20260918052416 -- reconstructed, not rewritten.

-- generate_invoices() loops every student without an invoice yet for the
-- given term and inserts one each. It relies on invoices_student_id_term_id_key
-- (a real UNIQUE(student_id, term_id) index) to stop a duplicate invoice ever
-- landing -- but doesn't catch the resulting unique_violation the way
-- mpesa_stk_callback_confirm() already does for its own concurrent-delivery
-- race. So if two staff trigger "Generate Invoices" for the same term at
-- close to the same moment (plausible right at the start of a term, or a
-- double-click on a run that takes a while), whichever call reaches a
-- student the other has already inserted gets an unhandled error --
-- and since this whole function is one transaction, that rolls back
-- EVERY invoice that same call had already created earlier in its own
-- loop, not just the one collision. Self-healing on retry (the `not
-- exists` filter just skips whoever's already invoiced), but wastes the
-- whole run and leaves whoever clicked it unsure whether fees went out.
--
-- Fixed the same way generate_invoice_number() and
-- get_or_create_student_financial_account() already serialize their own
-- per-school numbering races: a transaction-scoped advisory lock, scoped
-- here to (school_id, term_id) so a second concurrent call for the SAME
-- term simply waits for the first to finish (then finds nothing left to
-- do), while a call for a different term is unaffected. Nothing else
-- about the function changes.
